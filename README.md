# UdaciCards

"UdaciCards?" Project, is a mobile app that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. 

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


`npm start`
Runs your app in development mode with an interactive prompt. To run it without a prompt, use the --no-interactive flag.

Open it in the Expo app on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

`npm test`
Runs the jest test runner on your tests.

`npm run ios`
Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

`npm run android`
Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see React Native docs for detailed setup).



The App has be tested on Android and iOS
